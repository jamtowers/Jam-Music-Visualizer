# Jam Music Visualizer

Adds music visualization to YouTube Music and YouTube proper.

This is based on the [original extension](https://github.com/GreysonFlippo1/MusicVisualizer) written by Greyson Flippo in 2016, although most of the code has been rewritten, this has been spun out into it's own extension with [his permission](https://github.com/GreysonFlippo1/MusicVisualizer/issues/11#issuecomment-2580659250).

## Installation

Once I actually get this on the Chrome Web Store that will be the place to go, there are a number of features and bug fixes I want to do before then, but for the moment you can install it like a developer by following the steps below:

## Development

- Download or clone the repo
- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer Mode in the top right corner
- Click "Load Unpacked"
- Select the 'src' folder from the repo

## Firefox

Firefox support is not planned, if you want to add support feel free to fork this and make it happen.
